Hello, reader! You've just stumbled onto the first post of the Deep Anime Networks Blog! I bet you're wondering what on earth this site is about, so let me explain.

This is the blog for my upcoming project, which will be available at [deepanime.net](http://deepanime.net). Eventually, that site will have demos built around anime and deep learning (or more broadly, machine learning or artificial intelligence; I'll explain the difference in my next post). Examples of demos I hope to have include a page that identifies which anime your picture came from, a page that generates anime plot synopses, and maybe even a page that generates pictures of new anime characters!

Before I start any unfortunate misunderstandings, let me be clear: I am **not** claiming to be the first one to come up with these ideas. Researchers have studied applications of deep learning for a long time, and even the ideas I mentioned above have made their way into popular news and products (like Google image search). Rather, what I hope you get out of this blog and my website is meaningful knowledge about how deep learning works. Sure, you could go to grad school and spend years just learning how to *read* the papers that describe in gory details what you hear about in the news (like [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/)). Or, you could come to this site, where I hope to explain my demos in layman's terms.

At this point, some of you might be wondering, "Okay, but what's with the anime gimmick?" Well, there are a few reasons. First, I *really* like anime. I was raised on the 4Kids dubs of Yu-Gi-Oh and Once Piece (oh, how naive I was), and now I'm following the latest seasonal shows night after night. How about that My Hero Academia episode, am I right? (Replace "My Hero Academia" with whatever [r/anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime) is up in arms about this month). But more importantly, I wanted to fill a void that combined my love of anime and deep learning. I realized that the void was *not* applying deep learning to anime (as users of [waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp) will point out), but educating the average anime fan on *why* such tools work. If we're gonna learn something crazy, might as well be whimsical about it!

Here's another question you should be asking yourself: *"Are you even qualified to talk about this stuff?"* And here's my answer: I hope so! Right now, I'm a PhD student at the University of Michigan studying computer vision, which means I teach computers to understand visual media like images and videos. Computer vision has been taken over by deep learning, so I naturally have a lot of exposure to the topic. I even published a paper on [a deep learning method for finding where the camera is relative to an object by asking a human for help](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09859). In short, I live and breathe deep learning, so... maybe I'm qualified.

Anyways, I do hope you'll appreciate the things I have to say here. I doubt I'll update this blog too often; I'm still studying, after all. But if you do learn something, or have questions after reading my posts, discuss it in the comments!
